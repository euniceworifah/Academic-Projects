**OVERVIEW**
In many criminal justice systems around the world, prisoners deemed not to be a threat to society are
released from prison under the parole system prior to completing their sentence. Parole
boards are responsible for identifying which inmates are good candidates for release on parole. They
aim to release inmates who will not commit additional crimes after release. Failure to accurately predict
the risk of recidivism may lead to harmful consequences if a dangerous individual is put back into
society.

The goal of this project is two-fold: first, I endeavor to build and validate a model that predicts if an
inmate will violate the terms of his or her parole. Such a model could be useful to a parole board when
deciding to approve or deny an application for parole. Secondly, I intend to help parole boards identify
which key variables make a parolee more likely to relapse
