**OVERVIEW:** A leading expense management company in Latin America has contacted me to help analyze
corporate travel data in Brazil in 2019 and 2020 using SQL to facilitate the process. I am committed
to identifying patterns in corporate travel activity pertaining to all stakeholders involved (employees,
employers, travel agencies, and hotels). The insights uncovered through this analysis can be shared
with the different stakeholders to drive their business decisions.
