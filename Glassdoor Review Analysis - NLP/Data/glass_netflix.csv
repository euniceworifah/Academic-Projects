Thu Sep 20 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,How much does a functioning human cost?,515,#NAME?,"I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?

","So many people take advantage of the culture. It takes time for the glow to wear off, and then you realise the conmen out to play the system, and the politics masked behind ""feedback"" and ""sports team"" culture. People are fired not for performance, but because of internal power struggles. As an I/C, it becomes very demoralising because there is not much you can do to change it, or protect the good leaders or managers. Also, there is little to no career growth/mentorship. You are hired for one thing, and paid well for it, but you will only do that one thing until you leave. Diversity and inclusion is a farce, and focused on US definitions of what D&I should be. In the other offices in Asia or Europe, D&I is virtually non-existent and local representation and leadership is not protected or appreciated. As far as the company is concerned, Americans can do it all, in every country and industry. Caucasians are hired and promoted above people of colour, even in countries where they are the minority.

Cons
- Extremely competitive environment due to everyone being an overachiever. Work is never ending - 24/7 - on weekends, public holidays, during your vacation. I received emails from my manager on New Years eve with an expectation for me to respond. - Unlimited days off sound great, but when you go on vacation you need to be ready to work. Every. Single. Day. Nobody will take over your work or help offload when you are gone, it's up to you to make your work happen. Since I started 2 years ago I have checked my email every, single day. Including on my sisters wedding. - At any moment you can be given a new position at the office, that you might not want or need, but it's part of the constant change that is Netflix. If you don't accept it, your services are on longer needed. -...or even worse, you will be laid off. I've seen amazing people being let go because their manager didn't feel they were 'engaged enough' - as in, they wanted a life, disagreed one too many times or the reasoning was even more vague. - It feels like most that work here just go with the flow. If they keep their job one more month, great, if not...well they made some money and it looks good on their CV. - Generally you don't have any work stability and you need to be ready for that i.e. never knowing whether you will have a job in 3 months or not. - Maternity/paternity leave for a year never happens - if you get 2-4 months without having to worry about your job then that's fantastic. - If you have a family, and children, have a good long think about what matters in life before accepting the offer. I am 'lucky' to not to have kids, just a very supportive partner, and I still feel like the worst person ever at least 1-2 days per week (as I just always cancel outings with my partner and/or friends because of work). I see parents struggling weighing the glossy work that is Netflix vs their love for their children vs being able to buy that fancy bag or car. It's heartbreaking at times.

Tue Sep 22 2020, Marketing,Amsterdam,Current Employee ,Amazing...and you will drown in work.,14,"- Amazing colleagues - hard working, smart, supportive
- Strong brand and fantastic content creators, Netflix truly lives and breathes entertainment
- ","antly striving to improve the way we work, extremely agile work environment
- Generous - high monthly salary, good bonuses (option program) and pension, maternity/paternity support, 'unlimited' days off, free food/drink at the office and much more
Cons
- Extremely competitive environment due to everyone being an overachiever. Work is never ending - 24/7 - on weekends, public holidays, during your vacation. I received emails from my manager on New Years eve with an expectation for me to respond.
- Unlimited days off sound great, but when you go on vacation you need to be ready to work. Every. Single. Day. Nobody will take over your work or help offload when you are gone, it's up to you to make your work happen. Since I started 2 years ago I have checked my email every, single day. Including on my sisters wedding. 
- At any moment you can be given a new position at the office, that you might not want or need, but it's part of the constant change that is Netflix. If you don't accept it, your services are on longer needed.
-...or even worse, you will be laid off. I've seen amazing people being let go because their manager didn't feel they were 'engaged enough' - as in, they wanted a life, disagreed one too many times or the reasoning was even more vague.
- It feels like most that work here just go with the flow. If they keep their job one more month, great, if not...well they made some money and it looks good on their CV. 
- Generally you don't have any work stability and you need to be ready for that i.e. never knowing whether you will have a job in 3 months or not. 
- Maternity/paternity leave for a year never happens - if you get 2-4 months without having to worry about your job then that's fantastic. 
- If you have a family, and children, have a good long think about what matters in life before accepting the offer. I am 'lucky' to not to have kids, just a very supportive partner, and I still feel like the worst person ever at least 1-2 days per week (as I just always cancel outings with my partner and/or friends because of work). I see parents struggling weighing the glossy work that is Netflix vs their love for their children vs being able to buy that fancy bag or car. It's heartbreaking at times.
Advice to Management
- You are amazing in so many ways, but please try to see that workaholism and pinging on public holidays isn't cool. 
- Sitting in a meeting while you are extremely sick (Covid/flu, vomiting etc) isn't inspirational.
- Telling your staff that 'being burnt out isn't real/it doesn't exist - it's just the staff member being lazy' won't make us work harder. 

Finding balance in work and life is what makes us creative, what makes us passionate and what makes us happy. Netflix has changed so much in the past couple of years and for me the journey we are on is to change the world with our streaming content, we want to engage and spark joy - all around the globe and without prejudice. Please don't lose sight of what's important, and the positive impact we have on society as a whole (including the well being of your staff), in the chase for money alone.

When everyone would take company interests first, Netflix would be a dream place to work at. Unfortunately many engineers and managers first look at their paycheck and then act.

","The high stress workplace is real and true. We called it “Netflix and Drill” opposed to Chill. Employees on your team are not afraid to give you feedback which is encouraged in the workplace. Whether you are an assistant giving feedback to a director or the other way around , everyone is more or else walking on egg shells. 

Very little training and everyone expects you to be a top performer. There is the expression “drinking from the fire hose” , literally blasting you with information everyday. I was expected to support a director running a 15 person team perfectly after 1 week of questionable training. 

Also the hiring process was deceiving - they promised a great role with salary which has different benefits than hourly employees , then proceeded to demand references including my employer at the time BEFORE sending me their offer. I had to basically announce I was leaving to my former boss of over 2 years (with no choice) before even having an offer letter and they then had the audacity to reduce my role and benefits to an hourly role with brief apology. I had to take it and was laid off 5 months later...
Advice to Management
Netflix is undoubtedly a premiere movie studio and paying big cash to acquire / poaching the best talent from executive down to assistant. With this power it seems they’re losing senses with hiring and failing to provide a real structure of a company where people feel safe and excited to work. Everyone I encountered there was always stressed. Unless you’re Reed or a C-level exec , no one is safe technically but my advice would be to have it less about expecting a top performance from the start and actually train employees to become better at their jobs overtime.

While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology (although arguably it is becoming mature, as streaming is a commodity), the real drama is in Los Angeles, relating to content.
","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager. In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package. So, given that employees are not stupid, there is a lot of kissing up, resulting in a lot of comedy. Netflix believes in ""360 feedback,"" but everybody I know only does that to their peers, and they become very political with their management chain.

Fri May 22 2020, Manager,"Hollywood, CA",Former Employee ,It’s about fear and not about culture,43,"Salary higher than the rest of the industry
","Culture of fear. Indoctrination into a culture that is focused on intimidation and unattainable aspirations. The company grew so quickly that right-fit managers for a startup are now managing large numbers of people and they are incompetent. Due to this incompetence, the culture has become cut-throat where many people have been rapidly fired without justification. Often it’s political because their management fears the person being fired would replace them. Management is dishonest about the “transparency” of salaries and raises where favorites are rewarded rather than those who actually perform. The higher people are in levels of management, the greater the pressure to give up all personal life including family and children. Successful executives are dysfunctional with no personal lives. The culture memo or “deck” is a deceitful document now. It’s become weaponized and is used to humiliate people and fire them. There is no warning before being fired. It’s a surprise process where people are often told they are no longer employed and told to leave the building immediately. Management then communicates a fabricated version widespread to many employees by email or meetings, often stating that there were repeated coaching and warnings. There is none.

Advice to Management
Netflix likes to use an example where they fired 20% of the staff in the early days of the company and in the aftermath saw an increase in productivity. This strategy worked once in the past and is not a reliable benchmark. I witnessed high quality engineers and managers fired throughout my two years there. It was regular, and often, each time crushing team morale and weeks of productivity lost. In my one on ones I'd probe at everyone's happiness and never once did I hear anyone say they were happy to work there. All seemed to indicate they're sticking around for the pay - knowing their days are limited and one day will be rewarded with a ""generous severance package"" - as the culture deck describes.

As for the sexist/racist hiring practices, making radical short term adjustments to account for years for bias hiring practices is not the correct approach. Improving diversity within the company should be organic. What I witnessed in my last year there was nothing short of illegal hiring practices.

Alot of white people dont like working on black or urban content so you get management rolling their eyes and taking out their stresses because they have to answer to a POC or urban demo. HUGE problem Netflix needs to address that causes a toxic culture. Also the term ""well funded startup"" gets tossed around alot by upper management meaning that they have no idea what they are doing but will throw as much money as possible to try and fix the problem.

","Netflix as a company constantly says it is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, and do not tolerate “brilliant jerks”, or bullies. Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises, they would often side with the individual of higher rank. 

In my 2 years at Netflix, I’ve noticed that you don’t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company, you just have to be the loudest, and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones. 

Directors are often bullies and brilliant jerks, somethings sans brilliant - they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good. 

The director I am working for for example, often makes me solve director level problems. When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is “not my problem”. However if the problem was successfully solved, they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough. 

Netflix encourages weekly 1:1s with your cross functional partners and direct managers/directors, and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions. My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff, if too many questions were asked, they would be threatened with termination. 

Another issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job. Hiring of dynamic individuals is great, however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings. No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals, on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience. What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego, play politics, gossip, and take everything too personally. The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok, results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girls/boys culture. 

HR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it, but nothing ever gets done. In fact, employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues, because more than often HR would side with the upper management, brand the victimized employee a “trouble employee” and eventually they will be let go. And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work, which most of the time is completely false. It’s almost always politics and power play involved.

I have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant, hardworking and true stunning colleagues. A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening, their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage. 

How much you get paid also depends on who you know, and how much you know how to “charm” your bosses and the leadership team. I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors, because they are great with charming their bosses. How they determine how much each person gets paid, does not depend on experience, skill. It depends on friendships, and how well you sell yourself. 

The money and benefits are great, but they also come at a very high cost. If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment, then this is the company for you.
Advice to Management
It’s about time you put your words about not tolerating brilliant jerks, and your fair place work environment regardless of rank into action. Leadership often close their eyes on offenders due to them either being great at being part of the big boys/girls club or the fact they are of substantial rank. If this isn’t addressed you will keep losing your true stunning employees and be left with the ones who sound great but can they put their money where their mouth is.

They want you to be perfect They keep telling you that feedback is important and they care about it but at the end they don’t do anything with it Don’t get sick, don’t go on sick leave (psychical either mental sickness) otherwise your contract won’t get renewed. They will take care of you during your sick leave, arrange a reintegration plan, support you and tell you how good you’re doing and when your contract is about to end they won’t renew it. They will lie to you that your performance (you can check your performance yourself) was not good enough and let you go or even tell you that they cannot risk you’ll get sick again. They won’t even explain what exactly went wrong in your performance. They will offer you recommendations for future employers and even help with finding jobs. And they will add more to it, for example that you’re complaining about being scheduled for only late shifts. We have a special swap market for shifts since so many people are not happy with their schedules. Since Netflix switched to Majorel in April, a lot has changed. They are checking the average time of your calls and how many customers have called back after they contacted you. Basically, Netflix doesn’t like sick people, they don’t accept mentally ill. You need to be healthy, not complaining and always on time. Otherwise they’ll tell you you don’t fit.

- The logical thing/decision almost always happens.
- Amazing focus in the company, very little distractions
- Excellent communication flow. There are no secrets, everything is considered “context” that could help you do your job better.
","(To be clear these are all small cons! Netflix really is great!)

- Since it’s a small company that only hires A players, teams and scope can be small. 
- Could be more customer focused. Big focus on innovation, but primarily through the lens of what the data says and what the business values. This could be more balanced.
- Stock option Program is decent, but a little complicated and risky. I would prefer RSU or stock purchase plan instead of options.
- Location. Los Gatos is great but pretty far south. Not a great commute for most folks, particularly those living in the city.

Raise the bar on product innovation. While we have some big ideas, most seem incremental and solution led. Don’t be afraid to put a little more pressure on the teams to deliver.

Wed Feb 20 2019, Customer Service,"Salt Lake City, UT",Former Employee ,"Little culture, mostly just cult.",19,"Good entertainment content and service to consumers.

The good news; it’s easy to get a CSR job. They claim to hire only “top performers”, but you don’t even need to have call center experience to get hired. Also, no background check or drug screening. So if you’re into your substances, you won’t be alone. There are no performance criteria or reviews. Sounds good. However, makes it hard to know where you stand with them. Everyone is in fear of losing their jobs. 

The pay is good. They have to pay higher to keep up with their employee turnover problem. Benefits are OK. Paid parental leave is great. You only have to be employed for a short time and are eligible for months of paid leave, when you or your spouse has a baby. Work a month, get paid for four—a pretty good deal. They make a big deal out of the free coffee, green bananas and trail mix. They supply free toilet paper, too.
","Don’t let the name on the building fool you. The SLC call center is not like the Netflix you see on TV or in the media. It’s just a call center with a fancy name. When looking at reviews, you will want to distinguish between the corporate side of the business (Streaming, Production, Los Gatos, L.A.) and the SLC customer service facility. The customer service division is the stepchild of Netflix. The pay is different, benefits different, policies different, culture different and management way-different. 

You hear a lot about Netflix culture, values and diversity. Don’t mistake corporate’s PR for what’s going on in SLC. SLC has their own set of rules. All of the decision-makers are young, macho, wanna-be hipster, white men. They are very good at playing the game. Do it their way or get out. If you can get along with them, you may have a chance to hang around a while and put the fancy name on your resume. If you’re not one of them, there’s not much advancement opportunity. Netflix CS employees are disposable. Lots of turnover. Because people get sick of the ‘we’re Netflix and you should just be happy to work for us’ ego-crap or are fired for not fitting into the cult-ure.

Probably a good idea you off-ed the customer service business to outsourcers. It was clear you didn't care about this division or its employees.

- you don’t get paid for coming in. You only get paid when you’ve gone through 4 screens to open that special window to beck It’s always slow and they get angry that we’ve clocked in late. There’s 2 choice pay the extra 3 minutes or don’t complain that were not logged in on time.
- young and cute, you can do whatever you want
- mature people that have amazing statistics and 
quality ratings aren’t recognized.

Sun Jan 13 2019, Senior Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Senior software engineer,55,"Perks like free food, unlimited vacations (though a double edged sword really), swag, sometimes exciting projects and some good coworkers.
","Too much of hiring and firing. As a result everyone is looking out only for their roles and jobs. A lot of political crap. Esp not good for single income families or H1B visa holders. I've had people cry when they are let go because they don't have any other options. 

Take the good salary with the risk it gives. You will be let go, it's just a matter of when.

Growth opportunities are non-existent and your salary bumps are very subjective. 

Work life balance is a joke at times but it depends on team and manager. You can't have great work life balance for long since either your manager will be let go or you will be let go for not working harder.

Unlimited vacations are good in a good team but if your manager is a micromanager forget about it. It then becomes worse than limited vacations.

Thu Dec 13 2018, Customer Service Representative,Amsterdam,Former Employee ,Very disappointing,14,"As a customer service agent you earn around 1800€ per month, lunch is provided, however you pay 2 € for it per day, and there is full travel cost reimbursement. You get a voucher for your Netflix account.
","The employee surveillance is beyond good and evil: there is a camera every couple of meters and you get an electronic key that you have to use where ever you go, so every movement you make is tracked. Although Netflix advertises itself as a company where you are encouraged to take responsibility and be innovative, there is actually no trust whatsoever that they put in you. You can only grow in this company if you sacrifice your dignity and act only in the companies interest. There is an atmosphere created that doesn't allow you to be direct and open. You can give feedback, but don't expect that anything will happen or change to your benefit. You'll be told ""That was great feedback, thank you!"" and then they keep following the companies agenda again. There is no transparency from the top to the bottom and decisions are often made with no consideration of the preferences of the employees. You will be expected to work different shifts and on weekends and you will see your weekend days being cut off when the schedule changes at the end of the month, so be prepared to work more than 5 days in a row without compensation for the weekenddays they have stolen from you. You pretty much don't have a life anymore. If you face sexual harassment or verbal abuse from the customers over the phone, which happens almost every day at least once, you may get 5 minutes to calm down, but there is no help provided for your mental health. You really start feeling like you're not a human being but only a number that has to be optimized. Most important thing if you consider working there: Check the work law of the country so you know your rights. 
Netflix seems to work a lot on their reputation but what they do inside the company is a shame.

Mon Oct 29 2018,Anonymous,"Los Angeles, CA",Current Employee ,"Great company, with some growing pains",17,"When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues, they are not kidding: I am constantly impressed with the smart, thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis. I love the company's focus on Inclusion & Diversity (and, I honestly notice it often, by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting), and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles. The transparency is usually great, and it's fun to be a part of an exciting, growing company. The salary is exceptional, and the benefits are also excellent (note: hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits, but it's still great). There's a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to (e.g. my kid has a doctor's appointment, I will be WFH, etc.), as well as to make decisions that benefit the company, your team, etc. The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it, but I have found that it's pretty right on - there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says, but overall, it's on point.
","Work life balance is a thing, but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries - I work a couple of hours of OT a week, and I am generally ""on call"" in the sense that I will check my email after hours, but I am not expected to work at off hours - in fact, my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things. I do think upper management works very long hours, and that can lead to burn-out. The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation/personal time, and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor's appointments, stuff for your kids, WFH, etc. The firing culture doesn't seem to touch ICs as much as it does management. It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through, but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments, questions, concerns, etc. I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent, but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things. You have to be smart about choosing the right time/people. The onboarding/training needs a lot of work. Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating. I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here, but I am a year in, and feeling much more comfortable. They say it takes about 3 months to feel like you are not drowning, and 6 months to feel like you understand everything - that feels pretty accurate to me.

Their policy of fail well means you can make a mistake once. not twice. Terminations are frequent, and abrupt. In the last 6-8 months they have termed 3 supervisors, and about 15-18 people. There is a higher than average rate of churn here.

While they pay high wages, and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable. It makes it easy to attract new employees.

- Very cliquish environment, if you don't spend your time outside work with colleagues you can forget a chance at a promotion regardless of your ability or achievements
- MASSIVE turnover. The requirements are fairly straightforward but after a month or two, colleagues begin to drop like flies
- Assuming you have general people skills and the ability to arrive to work on time there are no new skills or training provided to advance your career outside being a more efficient Netflix agent.
Advice to Management
Rather than hiring outside and spending months getting new managers up to speed, hiring from within selecting those individuals who demonstrate exceptional ability should be promoted. Seeing there is a chance to advance one's career would provide incentive to stay with the company longer thus reducing high turnover and a constant need to find and train new employees.

","Everything. This is honestly the WORST company I have ever worked for. Absolutely horrible management, terrible training, and awful employee policies. DONT EVER WORK HERE IF YOU WANT TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT OR LIKE A HUMAN! This place is so far unattached from human feelings that if you ever have a family issue or emergency, you will lose your job for picking your family first. There is no care and compassion here, you come to work and act like a robot and are treated like the most unimportant employees in the world. Nothing is worth the emotional stress this place put me through.

GET IT TOGETHER! THIS IS THE MOST MISMANAGED SALT LAKE CALL CENTER. You also have the most SEXIST and UNQUALIFIED managers I have ever met in my life. Truly disappointed that Netflix has such a horribly run location.

","1. They either like you or they don’t. You HAVE to play work politics and meet as many upper level managers as possible. Your numbers, your adaption to their “culture”, and your prior work experience DO NOT matter when it comes to growth within the company. 2. You can’t get up and use the bathroom. Your breaks and lunches can be moved around (if approved by WFM) so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom. You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use. 3. You had an emergency? If you have the emergency hours to cover it, GREAT! But if you don’t, expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in. They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and it’s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before. 4. Coaching is a joke. Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on. What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan. My question is, aren’t the sups suppose to know the problems? Aren’t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action? It feels like I’m doing their job and they just say “great idea let me write this down and submit it!” They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down, they will never compliment you. 5. Utah is a right to work state. In plain English it means the company doesn’t need to have a reason to fire you, hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here. This law allows some employers to abuse the stability of employees and base their decisions on emotions instead performance.

You want us to live by NetflixCS values yet your own supervisors don’t live up to those values. Stop making it seem like it’s ok to voice our opinion when in reality you fire people for crossing that line or for exposing upper management.

","* It is absolutely required you ""graduate"" from training, if not, you will be fired if you make a couple mistakes there, or on the floor. Something they obviously don't tell you.

* Culture states there is transparency but I found that to be only true to some extent.

* There is an air of arrogance from management.

* They only want the cream of the crop, average TSR is just not good enough. This makes for a very high turnover rate.

* Netflix culture is friendly, cordial, professional, but it feels very restrictive, and subtlety-micromanaged.

","Ignorant leaderboard, the leaderboard does not listen to the agent, they don't care about the feedback - they only focus on the numbers and not the agents. Netflix recently turned up on the volume for english call, which caused multiple lines to sit in not stop queue since the agents also need to take care of their native language - So agents sits in back-to-back calls, switching between english and their native language. In perspective, when you get an angry/mad costumer and the call ends, their is no break what so ever, to get over the mad costumer, you just get a new call from another ""happy Netflix costumer"". After multiple conversations and meeting with supervisors - Their only comment is ""if you don't like it here at Netflix, then it is just not the right job for you"" aka they ask you to resign if you keep giving feedback or your opinion.
