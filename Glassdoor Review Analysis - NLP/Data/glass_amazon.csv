","TLDR: Don't join here unless you like a lot of work which being undervalued, or just need a FAANG company on your resume. - Management is a complete death match, with their only objective being stock price. - You're essentially seen as cattle in a farm for them to use. Completely disgusting the way employees are treated or valued - On-call is almost a guarantee on every team and it's usually 24/7 for a week. You need to carry your laptop around anywhere you go and you can be paged at odd hours to solve something complicated and still expected to show up the next day to work. - Any indication of ""mental health"" or looking after employees is nothing more than a formality and an after thought - Pay is completely garbage when you account the impact of oncall and the hours you work daily (they might say you should only work 40 hours, but give you 60 hours of work anyway and get you fired if you don't complete it) - Management blatantly lies or mis-guides you with their own personal interest while telling you, you will succeed by putting your team contribution above yours. - I can go on and on...

Advice to Management
Advice to Amazon is to treat managers as human instead of robots and make realistic expectations. Projects or Shift. Your choice. Evaluate managers based on shift cause that's majority of the work. Several managers don't work on shift properly and focus on projects and get all credit. The people making the shift successful are unsung heroes not getting the credit they deserve!

I had no time to make any attempt to gather paperwork or anything to counter their arguments. They promptly terminated me and sent me on my way, after even asking if there was anything I could do to help them. 

Also they will fight you on unemployment benefits. HR in meeting stated one reason for firing. While unemployment received a different reason for firing. I feel pretty betrayed by the company and will not work for them again. Kind of bummed as I enjoyed the field of work.

Advice to Management
Before you are hired, you do not really know what hours are available to work (from my memory). Or at least it is not obvious. Clear hours should be posted, so no one is shocked when the only hours open are 10pm-5am 4 nights a week.

The leadership principles are actually pretty well thought out.
","My team was handed a failing product created by a former team that rushed to ship and quit as soon as they got promoted. We were treated monstrously by leadership who quite literally yelled at us in closed rooms for being unable to save the failing product. Hours were long, sometimes 12-14 hours a day. Operational post-mortems were used as punitive threats instead of genuine opportunities for improvement. Oncall weeks often reached 10-20 pages a day. Multiple company-internal tech debt management consultants were brought in to help but gave up after no impact was made. High SDM turnover meant that nobody was available to advocate for the engineers, nobody got promoted, and tribal knowledge was lost.

I could not have had a worse experience. Recruiters email me every few weeks asking if I'll come back. Obviously other teams are different, but the potential reward is not worth the risk. If you can get a job at Amazon, you can get a job elsewhere where you will be treated better.

Tue Dec 10 2019, Warehouse Associate,"Shelby Township, MI",Current Employee ,Know the Truth in working the Warehouse,2,"At the location I work at you are guaranteed a 25 cent raise for every six months you are employeed there. Amazon provided a 75 dollar credit to Zappos for proper work shoes. (they own Zappos and the shoes on that site are expensive) This is specific to my location but currently we are receiving $125 bonus per week if we work 20 hours in a week and do not use UPT (unpaid time). The employees actually get the $125 after taxes. (they make sure to give you more than $125 so that when taxes are taken out you get the $125)
","During peak season, the warehouse workers are asked to do 55 hours per week back to back.(11 hour days ) Work life balance during peak season does not exist. You will be sore and your back will more than likely hurt. At my location,there is more than one case of sexual harassment and bullying /retaliation. As a wareshouse associate, if you want to move up, you must speak up to your manager, they do not do career develop for each person.
Advice to Management
Work on changing the environment to a happier place. Give opportunities to Associates for career develop with the managers taking the lead by meeting each assoicate to understand what they would like to do with their careers.

You should do something to control the noise levels in common areas, cafes inside the building and the dogs, it is a workplace after all! For how crowded the seating is, dogs barking/whimpering is so uncomfortable. May be as part of connections questions, you should include some noise-related questions.
