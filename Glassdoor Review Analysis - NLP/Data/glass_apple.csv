","Don't be fooled by the 'Everything is awesome' vibe the managers try to put on, office politics are very real in every store and even though you will get along with most of your coworkers, you are competing with them if you want to advance anywhere. Demands from head office feel very out of touch with what is actually happening in stores. Managers get moved/removed often due to performance, politics, etc. so get what you can from a manager that you connect with because you never know how long it will last. In 8 years of working at Apple, I've only heard of 2 people moving to corporate and both were due to connections to district management; if that was your plan to get into corporate I would highly reconsider that path.

","You will never get a weekend free. Management is petty and vengeful. The work is non-stop. You start your day with a “download”. This is a thinly veiled attempt to reinforce corporate groupthink so you can hit the floor and be a company shill. You start taking Genius Bar appointments immediately and the work is relentless. One angry customer after another, every ten minutes. And if you manage to find a small moment of peace with a funny or reasonable customer the lead genius will come over and force you to “multi-task”. That is, since you’re smiling, that means you have the capacity to attend two customers at once. And god forbid you have a five minute chat with a coworker to vent and clear your thoughts. That will get you reprimanded. Make no mistake, this job WILL burn you out. Having two days off in a row is a fleeting luxury, coming usually once a month or two. and Apple does this on purpose. Unless you have won a genetic lottery and are attractive. Then you can sleep with a manager and “earn” a merit increase or have some weekends approved. This happens CONSTANTLY. Employees will often sleep with each other, as well. Mainly because your erratic schedule will alienate you from everyone you care about, and prevent you from meeting new people. Once you are hired, your life becomes about one single purpose: get people to give their money to Apple and if they’re unhappy with their product, you have to fawn over them until they’re willing to spend more. Also, if you stand up for yourself and set boundaries of what kinds of unreasonable and abusive customers you are and aren’t willing to interact with? Or what kind of work / life balance is acceptable? Boom. That’s it. You’re never getting a raise again and everything but the legal minimum for time off is what you can expect to see. Then you will clock out for lunch. And if you are literally one minute late, and I do mean literally, you will be taken into the office and reprimanded. Clock in early all you want, but if you’re one minute late, you’re in trouble. But the creepy middle aged dork in sales that is a sexual predator and corners young women and tries to convince them to sleep with him? That guy will work there for YEARS because he can generate revenue. And at the end of your day, you will be forced to sit through an “upload”. This yet another thinly veiled attempt to reinforce corporate groupthink and try to make you forget the gruelling, depressing 9 hours you just spent in a silver, windowless, featureless rectangle of a room getting belittled and accused by selfish, whiny children hiding in adult bodies because they can’t bear to be without their overpriced, luxury cell phones for eight seconds. Its like if a liquor store opens and you’re forced to apologize and placate all the jonesing alcoholics whom spent an hour waiting to yell at you because they had to spend a whole night without any vodka. But you’ll clock out ten minutes late at ten at night because of that stupid upload and you make your way home in a rush since you have to be up at 7AM to do it all again. Because it’s a Saturday and there will already be a line of people outside the store, clutching to their liquid damaged iPhones, shaking with withdrawal and eager to tell you it’s your fault that they broke it because you should’ve made the phone everything-proof.

And at the end of your day, you will be forced to sit through an “upload”. This yet another thinly veiled attempt to reinforce corporate groupthink and try to make you forget the gruelling, depressing 9 hours you just spent in a silver, windowless, featureless rectangle of a room getting belittled and accused by selfish, whiny children hiding in adult bodies because they can’t bear to be without their overpriced, luxury cell phones for eight seconds. Its like if a liquor store opens and you’re forced to apologize and placate all the jonesing alcoholics whom spent an hour waiting to yell at you because they had to spend a whole night without any vodka. 

But you’ll clock out ten minutes late at ten at night because of that stupid upload and you make your way home in a rush since you have to be up at 7AM to do it all again. 

Because it’s a Saturday and there will already be a line of people outside the store, clutching to their liquid damaged iPhones, shaking with withdrawal and eager to tell you it’s your fault that they broke it because you should’ve made the phone everything-proof.

Tue Feb 27 2018, Specialist,,Former Employee ,Specialist,2,#NAME?,"- Serious favouritism by management, especially when it comes to promotions. There's a lot of talk about all these opportunities to move up, but if you're not one of the hardcore kool-aid drinkers, you won't get to move up no matter how good your results are. The jobs for higher positions are few and far between, and always go to the person who sucks up the most. You need to get permission to apply for new positions in the store. There's not really any retail to corporate growth (at least in my city).
- Like all retail, customers can be really challenging, especially because they have absurdly high expectations for Apple.
- Training on products was pretty poor. More service-based than technical or products based, which made interactions with customers very challenging. 
- Scheduling is a mess. Tough to get 2 days off in a row sometimes. Hours fluctuate a lot, some weeks you get 35, some weeks you get 8. NO paid sick days for part-timers, so if you're scheduled an 8 hour shift and its one of your only shifts that week, its either lose your paycheck or go into work sick. 
- Not much work-life balance on the retail schedule.
Advice to Management
Recognize your employees who are hard working and doing well, but aren't going out of their way to show it off to you. Stop focusing all your energy on the people who are already at the top. Its all about ""one team"" but it doesn't feel like it at all. Be more honest with us.
