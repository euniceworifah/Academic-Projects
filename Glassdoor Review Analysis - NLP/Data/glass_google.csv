Mon Oct 26 2020, Technical Solutions Engineer,"Waterloo, ON",Current Employee ,Big company - safe haven,1,#NAME?,"- Big company. Which means the company culture is rather diluted in day to day experience. What really matters is the team, organization, manager and role that you sign up for
- Tough to make an impact as there are plenty of smart people around. This means the ones who are well entrenched in the system tend to perform better. As a new comer, don't expect immediate success
- Imposter syndrome is a real thing. But you need to remember that this is a well oiled machine and will function very well without any single individual. This includes even the CEO - Pichai. Yes, Google will run very well without him.
- Expect to be low balled in terms of salary/designation. Google has plenty of applicants. And they can always find a better person for the role at a cheaper price given enough time. So be ready to eat humble pie and join on the company's terms.

","In some divisions there's a strong incentive to spend a lot of time on your own perf (self evaluation), there are a few employees that are ""professional perfers"", they're excellent at embellishing their work while more humble coworkers who do a better job might not shine as much. Also in smaller satellite offices it's difficult to have the visibility required for promotion.
Advice to Management
Make sure the workers identified as top performers really are top performers at all the levels, and if they're on the sales side it would be useful to check with their customers how they feel. (e.g. did a sales rep block 3 days in the week to work on his or her perf when his or her customers are waiting for answers?). Otherwise amazing company to work for, it's very difficult to keep a great company culture with the huge growth from the last 15 years, good job!

Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day. 2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc. 3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse). 5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).
","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change. 2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously. 3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance. 4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(

Fri Jun 21 2013, Program Manager,"Mountain View, CA",Former Employee ,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable",2982,"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).
","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(
Advice to Management
1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management. 

2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done; what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed? 

3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment.

Tue Feb 02 2021, Associate Account Strategist,"Redwood City, CA",Current Employee ,Foot In Door To Google,1,"You get to work with intelligent (socially and book smart) people constantly whether they are your customers or your coworkers. You don’t have to know Google Ads to start the role and they train you in the product very well. By a year in the role you’ll be in the 95% percentile of Google ads experts and you’ll have the opportunity to explore other roles at Google if you please. If you do well your pay goes through yearly refreshes and It can make a huge difference. You get to bring your whole self to work and that’s really cool.
","If you are joining the role from another company It is very vague if you will come into the role as an L2 (hourly) or L3 and that can make a big difference in compensation. People with 2-3 years of experience can make the same as a college grad and that can be frustrating. While pay has the potential to go up if you perform well, promotions can feel slow due to only 2 cycles a year which can limit you from going to roles that require certain levels. You will be challenged and need to have discipline, but it’s not a cutthroat environment in the slightest everyone helps everyone.

Wed Feb 03 2021, Software Engineering Director,"Mountain View, CA",Current Employee ,"Google is an amazing place to work for the people, the growth, scale, variety and perks!",0,"-) The people (coworkers are smart & nice). 
-) The growth (you willl get invaluable development feedback from 360 degree reviews, that, if you are able to internalize and incorporate the feedback, will propel your career forward)
-) Variety. So many groups in one place, that when you're ready for your next career exploration, it will be easy and smooth. Google wants to be the last place you'll ever work.
-) Scale. If you want to have lots of users, in some cases billions, Google is a lot of fun and you are helping many people who use your product directly or indirectly. 
-) Free food and stocked ""micro-kitchens"" with snacks. And, the shuttles (okay, in 2020-21 this isn't a factor, but it will be when we all go back.)
Help the environment and make friends with neighbors, while riding a climate controlled bus with leather seats and friendly bus drivers, to work & back. If you can read in cars, you also will probably be able to get all your email done on the way to and from work, and the day is just about getting real work done.
","It is a large company, with over 100,000 employees, so there are often many people involved in any given project. You will need to be patient to work with stakeholders. Most teams have minimal politics so this goes smoothly. Things take longer than in a startup, but on the other hand, the scale of users, products, infrastructure is much greater.
