Thu Sep 10 2020, Technical Sourcer,"Vancouver, BC",Current Employee ,People Focused Company,0,"I have worked here less than a year so far, but I have loved every minute of it! I joined during COVID and it became clear extremely quickly how much they deeply care about their employees and their well being. Can work-life balance be challenging in a company full of top performers with high performance expectations? Absolutely! But it is really on you to manage your own time and success. There is no pressure from the organization to work after hours and using your PTO and leave options is greatly encouraged. 

I personally love the casual and open culture. When they say ""bring your whole self to work"" they mean it. Coming from a more traditional company it took a little time to adapt to this as well as to adjust to how people communicate with each other but now I'm hooked. 

The opportunities for continued learning and professional growth seem boundless. They really like to promote from within and there are so many resources for building your career based around what interests you the most.
","One challenging aspect is that everyone has an option about Facebook and we are constantly on the news, but that's true of any top company. Recruiters should be used to having tough skin anyways.

Tue Sep 18 2018, Client Partner,"Toronto, ON",Current Employee ,Client Partner - Financial Services Better than I could have possibly imagined.,8,"Instead of completing a formal review, I’ll share a post I made to celebrate my 1 year anniversary since joining Facebook. —- Today marks my first year at Facebook. We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work anniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that’s built around these Faceversaries. It’s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. When you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company. Those are always funny or emotional, or both. So, what can I share after my first year here? TL;DR: Work with and learn from the very best people. Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. I get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn’t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. I’ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that’s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more. Internally, they say every day at Facebook is equivalent to a week. I now know why. I have the autonomy, authority, and support I need to be successful and run my marketing consulting business the way I see fit. Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people. I have access to incredible benefits that I’m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I’m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. Facebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don’t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I’m involved in them. I’ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. There are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact. I’ve always been fortunate in my career. I’ve worked on amazing teams, on fascinating projects, with inspiring mentors and leaders. Facebook has been a continuation of that for me. But, I must say, I’ve never been this happy.

Wed Feb 03 2021,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Great place to start your IT Support career but very hard to move up at FB,0,"- Telling people you work at Facebook gives you immediate report and oddly almost celebrity status - You get to work with the most educated and motivated people in the world. - Global company so offices everywhere and constantly expanding - This role has a good work life balance because you never have to bring your work home with you. You work 8-5 - This role allows you to interact with anyone and everyone at the company. - Open culture and internal systems. Very accepting of different lifestyles and perspectives. - NO DRESS CODE (wear yoga pants to work or PJ pants if you want) - Free food breakfast lunch and dinner plus snack and drinks always available. - MPK (Menlo Park) is Facebooks Headquarters and has so many different amenities like on site gyms, ice cream, coffee shops and it’s all free. Except for certain on campus coffee shops like Philz, Verve, Blue Bottle. - Free Purple Tie dry cleaning or wash/fold laundry service on campus - You can request reimbursement for up to $720 per year for healthy lifestyle related expenses like massages, ski lift tickets, meditation apps/service fees like FitBit premium, HeadSpace etc. They even opened it up to use for the purchase of fitness equipment like the Apple Watch, barbells, and most things fitness related. - $75 per month can be reimbursed for home internet during covid wfh Hardware Perks: - Facebook FTEs (Full Time Employees) always get the latest hardware when you start. - Upgrade your laptop and phone every 2yrs - Unlimited data and tethering for your work phone with an option to port your personal number and use it for work and personal for free. - If you want any special paid software for work it’s easy to request and get it approved. - When offices open again there are IT Equipment Vending Machines full of free accessories like chargers/cables/adapters/mice
","- You work 8-5 minus a 1hr scheduled lunch. - You are considered a shift worker so every hour on the clock is scheduled for a particular support queue. (Live chat, phones, tickets, project work etc.) - VERY HIGH VOLUME! This job will keep you very busy! - The expectations are very high compared to most entry level “Helpdesk” style jobs. You’re currently expected to resolve at least 3 tickets per hour during covid wfh just to meet the minimum expectations. This sounds easy but try doing it 8hrs per day everyday while dealing with wfh and other challenges while remote. - This role hires IC (Individual Contributor) levels (2, 3, or 4) FB likes to put you at the lowest level they can. If you have 5-7yrs+ of industry experience you should be an IC4 or 5 in most other roles but this one will likely offer you IC2 or 3 but you should push for IC4. - You must be an IC 4 before you can even apply for any people manager or team lead roles. It’s very hard to get promoted to a new level in this role because your time is fully spent in core support work but promotions can only happen if you also find time to discover and drive cross functional global impact that you can measure with data. You must do this whole also maintaining your core workload which can be very difficult.

","Management in the GBG Scaled team in Dublin aren't going to focus on your personal development or take into account your desired career trajectory. It's unfortunate as they hired me as a graduate in 2017 at a time when the company was expanding greatly. They did so with the promise of a fulfilling career (it wasn't) and a clear path to progression. Fast forward nearly three years and unfortunately, their support for graduates has gone out the window to be replaced by a preference for Agency or 'Industry' hires who, despite my longer tenure, come in at a higher IC level. Now arguably, I can see people seeing the value in this. And to an extent so can I. However Management (I'm thinking of my manager and her director here) have managed to get into their positions through the 'rising tide' effect. Meaning, they happened to be at FB at the right place and at the right time. So their seniority or job title doesn't match their ability to lead or nurture their team. It's stressful as we face Agencies a lot of the time and given that Management are very focused on pursuing their own projects and building their own personal brands and connections (we have an internal review process called a PSC), they are not incentivized to genuinely look for and nurture our careers. They ignored the Tiktok threat and disregarded them until 4 people from our team were poached, and still their was no action on their part. Unfortunately, the final straw for me was when I felt that my role didn't match my job title. A partner Manager is supposed to consult and focus on Business Development but Management have us doing support tasks and personal favors for their friends in the industry. Any time I pushed back, It reflected on my performance review which encouraged me to pick up the phone (metaphorically speaking) and take up a job with Tiktok in a completely different country!
