## **E-Commerce Customer Churn: Data Analysis and Prediction**</div>
<br>

In this analysis, we explore a problem faced by many e-commerce businesses: **Customer Churn**. Customer churn is when customers stop doing business with an entity. To elaborate, in non-subscription e-commerce business models, this occurs when a customer gradually reduces their purchase frequency over time, or may all of a sudden never buy again. In 2020, the average customer churn rate in the US within the online retail industry was 27%. In today's era of e-commerce, churn rate is an important indicator, and could signal something problematic with a company's business model or product. Companies are becoming increasingly more aware that retaining existing customers is the best marketing strategy to follow in order survive in today's competitive market.

For this project, our objective is to:
- Explore data and understand customer attributes that correlate to a higher risk of churn
- Build a model to predict customer churn
